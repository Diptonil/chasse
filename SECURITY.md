# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As of now we are at the first release, with only v1.0.0 on the platter. It is recommended for all users to upgrade to this version, in case anyone is still using the developmental versions (< 1.0.0).
If reported, security releases will be made available for only the current LTS version (v1.0.0).

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
|  1.0.0  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- In case any sort of security issue pops up, the first thing a user can do is to open up an issue **with the `vulnerability` label**.
- The moderators shall look into the issue within 24 hours and get back with either a fix, a recommendation or any resource or comments pertaining to the fix of the issue.
- The issue shall also be marked critical (in most cases, unless the level of disruption is agreed upon by the moderators and reporters to be negligibly low).
